# CSE351 - Memory Allocation Lab
CSE 351 SPQ23. Taken with Elba Garza.
Overview
Learning Objectives
Implement a memory allocator using an explicit free list.
Examine how algorithm choice impacts tradeoffs between utilization and throughput.
Read and modify a substantial C program.
Improve your C programming skills including gaining more experience with structs, pointers, macros, and debugging.

In this lab, you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C programs, i.e., your own version of the malloc and free routines. This is a classic implementation problem with many interesting algorithms and opportunities to put several of the skills you have learned in this course to good use. It is quite involved. Start early!
